Diabetes Risk Classifier â€” Pima Indians (Jupyter Notebook/vscode)

This project builds an end-to-end machine learning pipeline in Python to predict diabetes risk from tabular clinical features. It uses scikit-learn with a scaled, class-balanced Logistic Regression and evaluates with Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, and ROC-AUC. Artifacts such as the trained model, metrics, and plots are saved for reuse and documentation.
